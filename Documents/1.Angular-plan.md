Standalone components, routing, guards, resolvers

Signals (state + reactivity), computed/effect patterns

Forms: Reactive Forms (validation, custom validators)

HTTP + interceptors, error handling, retry/backoff

Change detection + performance basics (trackBy, OnPush mindset)

# State management

Start simple: services + signals

Then learn patterns: store-like architecture (NgRx / ComponentStore) when apps get big

# Testing

Unit tests for components/services (Jest/Karma depending setup)

Component testing patterns, mocking HTTP

Basic e2e (Playwright/Cypress)

# Build & tooling

Angular CLI, environment configs, build optimization

Linting/formatting (ESLint, Prettier)

Git workflow (branches, PRs, rebase)

# UI & design skills

One UI kit well (Angular Material is common)

Design fundamentals: spacing, typography, layout consistency

Working from Figma (inspect, tokens, exporting assets)

# APIs & real-world app skills

REST basics (pagination, filtering, auth flows)

Auth: JWT/session concepts, route protection, refresh tokens conceptually

Security basics: XSS, CSRF, storing tokens safely (high-level understanding)

# Performance & quality

Bundle size awareness, lazy loading routes

Web vitals basics, image optimization

Error monitoring/logging mindset

# Deploy & “professional” basics

Hosting: static hosting/CDN concepts, environment variables

CI/CD basics (build/test on PR)
